# Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

This is where I practice and refine my algorithms and data structures skills, written in Python and Typescript
using test frameworks (PyTest and Jest).

## Graph

- Implementing a Graph and Vertices from scratch
- Creating a parser that takes .txt (a map) as an input and outputs a graph
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijsktra algortihm, Kruskal Algorithm A\*, Topological Sort, etc.)

## Trees

- Implementing a Tree from scratch
- Creating a parser that takes .txt (a map) as an input and outputs a graph
- Tree Algorithms (DFS, BFS, AVL, etc.)

## LinkedList

- Creating a LinkedList from scratch
- Creating a parser that takes .txt (a list) as an input and outputs a linkedlist

## Dynamic Programming

- Solving 1D and 2D dynamic programming challenges
